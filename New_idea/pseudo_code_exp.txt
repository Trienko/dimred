split dataset into k-folds (pixel-wise).

create yearly data dictionary for each train-validation set for each fold.

do a grid search for each time-step to find best hyperparameter (on each train-validation set).

re-train using the entire train-vaidation set.

use this model to determine the effectiveness of each fold

here we can select a different model for each time-step as well. 

choose model which performs best.
