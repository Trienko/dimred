\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a class label agnostic dimensionality reduction comparison framework. 
We illustrate the usefulness of this framework at the hand of a case study. For our case study, we consider two prominent land cover classes in the Gauteng province, namely natural vegetation and settlement using an 8 year MODIS dataset. We use the framework to compare two 
feature extraction techniques, namely PCA and FFT. For the case study we considered in this paper, the PCA technique produced a reduced feature space which was 15\% more 
separable than the feature space produced by the FFT method.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Hallo \cite{almeida2015}.

\section{Dataset}

\section{Preliminaries}

\section{Methodology}
%At the start of the analysis the MODIS data set had the following dimensions (592,368,7). The first dimension is associated with the number of MODIS pixels, the second dimension indicates the number of observations, 
%while the third dimensions represents the number of spectral bands consdidered. The datset is then reshaped into a cube with the following dimensions (x,45,7), i.e. we treat each year of data as 
%a totally new observation. Let us denote this reshaped data set as $\mathcal{D}$.  Moreover, let $\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{b}}$ denote a single MODIS pixel from $\mathcal{D}$ that contain only the time-series 
%associated with spectral bands $\mathbf{b}$. The dimension of $\mathbf{x}$ is therefore $(45,|\mathbf{b}|)$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes the lenght of its operand. We can now build a statistical model for each two band combination for every time-step of the year using either a supervised or an unsupervised strategy.
%We considered two band combinations as we know that two-band derived indices, like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegitation Index), achieve good results. 
Let $\mathbf{x}$ denote a MODIS pixel from the reshaped Gauteng dataset $\mathbf{X}$. Each MODIS pixel $\mathbf{x}$ contain seven time-series; each time-series is associated with a spectral band and contain 45 observations.
We will use the subscript $t$ to denote a time-step index and the subscript $\mathbf{b}$ to denote a composite spectralband index. The superscript $c\in\{v~\textrm{(vegetation)},s~\textrm{(settlement)}\}$ acts as a labelling index. XX showed, that we can employ the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to classify $\mathbf{x}$ as either belonging to the vegetation or the settelment class if 
the underlying time-varying model of the two classes are known. The details of this classification strategy follows below. The aforementioned time-varying model $\{q_{t,\mathbf{b}}^c\}_{t=1,2,\cdots,45}$ of each class $c$ and spectral subset $\mathbf{b}$ is composed of 45 densities. Each density is associated with a time-step $t$. 
For each unlabelled MODIS pixel $\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{b}}$ we can then compute the following scalar quantity 
\begin{equation}
S = \sum_{t=1}^{368} \ln \frac{q_{(t-1)\%45+1,\mathbf{b}}^v(\mathbf{x}_{t,\mathbf{b}})}{q_{(t-1)\%45+1,\mathbf{b}}^s(\mathbf{x}_{t,\mathbf{b}})}. 
\end{equation}
The unlabelled pixel $\mathbf{x}$ is then classified as $v$ if $S\geq 0$ and as $s$ otherwise. We can estimate this time-varying model using either a supervised or an unsupervised 
approach. The approach in was to use a supervised approach. We elaborate on this in the next two sections.


\subsection{Supervised Time-Varying Model}
Let $\mathbf{X}_{t,\mathbf{b}}^c$ represent all the data from $\mathbf{X}$ at time-step $t$, labbeled as class $c$ and associated with spectral bands $\mathbf{b}$. We can now fit a Gaussian density 
on $\mathbf{X}_{t,\mathbf{b}}^c$ the dimension of which is determined by the number of spectral bands one considers. To accomplish this in practise we used the 
xxx function from scikit-learn. As we are creating separate time-varying models for $v$ and $s$ we set the number..of ..components parameter of to 1 when using it.

\subsection{Unsupervised Time-Varying Model}
Let 






ated at each time-step of the year 
using some available training data. We can express this

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ref}
We presented a label agnostic feature extraction comparison framework in this paper. We demonstrated its usefulness by employing it and a case study to compare two feature extraction methods,
namely FFT and PCA (we also found that the PCA approach outperformed the FFT approach).
