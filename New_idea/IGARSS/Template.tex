\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a class label agnostic dimensionality reduction comparison framework. 
We illustrate the usefulness of this framework at the hand of a case study. For our case study, we consider two prominent land cover classes in the Gauteng province, namely natural vegetation and settlement using an 8 year MODIS dataset. We use the framework to compare two 
feature extraction techniques, namely PCA and FFT. For the case study we considered in this paper, the PCA technique produced a reduced feature space which was 15\% more 
separable than the feature space produced by the FFT method.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Hallo \cite{almeida2015}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ref}
We presented a label agnostic feature extraction comparison framework in this paper. We demonstrated its usefulness by employing it and a case study to compare two feature extraction methods,
namely FFT and PCA (we also found that the PCA approach outperformed the FFT approach).
