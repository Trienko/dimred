\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present an example framework which can be used to compare hypertemporal remote sensing dimensionality reduction techniques. 
We illustrate the usefulness of this framework at the hand of a case study. We use the framework to compare two 
feature extraction techniques, namely PCA and FFT. For our case study we consider a vegetation/settlement MODIS dataset associated with the Gauteng province in South Africa. 
For the dataset we considered in this paper we found that the PCA technique performed on average 1.3 times better (across the spectral dimension) than the FFT method.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed in the remote sensing literature \cite{grobler2012}. However, there are few empirical comparison studies between the different methods
in the literature (especially in the case of hypertemporal remote sensing data). In this paper we present a basic comparison framework which if it is extended can provide 
a meaningful way of empirically comparing different dimensionality reduction techniques. To illustrate how this framework functions, we employ it and a case study to compare two hypertemporal 
dimensionality reduction techniques, namely PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

For our case study we consider a hypertemporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. In this paper, we will employ a labelled as well as an unlabelled version of this data set.
We do this in order to show that this method can be applied to labelled as well as unlabelled data. Comparing feature reduction techniques that were applied to labelled 
data can  be achieved by comparing the accuracy of a host of supervised classifiers which  

is to emphasize the proposed method's usefulness. It can be used to compare the efficacy of two feature reduction approaches 

containing both vegetation and settlement pixels 
as well as an unlabelled version of this same dataset. ,
not only can it compare the efficacy of feature reduction techniques on a labelled dataset (which can admitantly also be accomplished by evaluating the success of a host of different supervised classifiers which were trained using the 
labelled dataset), it can also be used to compare the efficacy of feature reduction thecniques on a dataset which does not contain any class labels.
it can be used to compare to feature reduction techniques even if the dataset contains no class labels. 
Our study area is located in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Settlemet expansion is one of the most pervasive forms of landcover change in southern Africa. It is therefore of the utmost importance to be able to discern 
between these two land cover types, especially in the case of South Africa \cite{grobler2012}. We also use an unlabelled version of the aforemention The reason for considering both a labelled and unlabe

PCA has been applied extensively to remote sensing data \cite{byrne1980,crist1984} and in particular to remote sensing time-series \cite{eastman1993,hall2003}. PCA remains a popular dimensionality reduction technique. It was recently used to analyze the spatio-temporal variability of 
the Pantanal vegetation cover (which is the largest tropical wetland in the world) \cite{almeida2015}.  %and to determine spatio-temporal patterns between multiple time-series

Harmonic features (i.e. the FFT) have also been used extensively for landcover classification and change detection \cite{jakubauskas2002}. It was recently used in a tree/grass fractional cover case study conducted in 
the Kruger national park (South Africa) \cite{ibrahim2018}.

We start the paper by discussing the dataset we considered in a bit more detail. We then present the feature extraction comparison framework. Lastly we present our results and conclusions.

\section{Classes, Study Area and Data Description}
The hypertemporal dataset that we made use of in this paper is composed of 8 day (45 obervations per year) composite MODIS MCD43A4 BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) corrected 500 m land surface
data and correspond to a total area of approximately 230 km$^2$  of the Gauteng province of South Africa. 
In this paper we consider two classes of landcover, namely vegetation and settlements. The settlements class contains pixels consisting of about
50\% buildings, and 50\% vegetation, whereas the vegetation class contains pixels which contain more than 90\% vegetation. 

The dataset we used contain about 592 vegetation pixels and about 333 settlement pixels. Each pixel consist of eight time-series that contain 368 samples (extracted between 2000 and 2008). The eight time-series can be associated with the first seven MODIS bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
The MODIS pixels where hand picked after inspecting two high resolution Système Probatoire d’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) images from the year 2000 and 2008 respectively. 
We selected MODIS pixels that according to the SPOT images had the appropriate percentage land cover type in a MODIS pixel and did not change from 2000 to 2008 \cite{ackermann2011}.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:met}
We describe the proposed comparison framework in Section~\ref{sec:comp}. We then discuss the two dimensionality reduction techniques we considered in Section~\ref{sec:PCA} and Section~\ref{sec:fft}. 
We end the section by discussing the distance metric we used to quantify the separability between the two landcover classes (after feature extraction). 

\subsection{Comparison Framework}
\label{sec:comp}
The proposed comparison framework:

\begin{description}
 \item[Feature Reduction] Apply the different feature reduction approaches to a hypertemporal data set (repeat for each spectral band).
 \begin{itemize}
  \item In this paper, we used the \textsc{scikit-learn}\footnote{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html} library to run PCA on each MODIS band. We then stored the two largest principal components for each band in a feature matrix (Section~\ref{sec:PCA}). 
  \item In this paper, we used the \textsc{numpy}\footnote{http://www.numpy.org} library to extract the mean and seasonal component out of each MODIS pixel for each band and stored the result in a feature matrix (Section~\ref{sec:fft}). 
 \end{itemize}
 \item[Density Estimation] Estimate the densities associated with the reduced feature space for each feature reduction method and landcover type. 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item In this paper, we made use of \textsc{scikit-learn} to fit Gaussian densities to the feature space of each method for each band and land cover type (considered a maximum of two features). 
 \end{itemize}
 \item[Hellinger Distance] Compute the Hellinger distance between the different densities fitted on the reduced feature space of each landcover type and compare to 
 find the best dimensionality reduction technique (Section~\ref{sec:HD}). 
\end{description}

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}
\label{sec:PCA}
%Let us assume that it is centered, i.e. column means have been subtracted and are now equal to zero.
The two largest principal components associated with the time-series of each MODIS pixel were extracted and stored in a feature matrix for each band. The above is realized
via:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Let $\mathbf{X}_b$ denote an $n\times t$ centered matrix (i.e. column means have been subtracted and are now equal to zero) containing MODIS band $b$ hypertemporal data (to reduce clutter we will omit the $b$ subscript in the rest of the paper). Moreover, assume that $n$ denotes a MODIS pixel index and that $t$ denotes a time-step index. 
 \item Form the $t\times t$ covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C} = \frac{\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}}{n-1}. 
\end{equation}
\item Diagnonalizing $\mathbf{C}$ results in:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{V}^T,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{L}$ is a $t\times t$ diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{C}$, in descending order, on its diagonal and $\mathbf{V}$ is a $t\times t$ matrix 
containing the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues found in $\mathbf{L}$ (each column of $\mathbf{V}$ contains an eigenvector). 
\begin{itemize}
\item The eigenvectors contained in 
$\mathbf{V}$ are also known as the principal axes or directions of the data.
\item The principal components are computed by projecting the data onto the principal axes.
\end{itemize}
\item Compute the principal components via $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{V}$ (the dimensions of $\mathbf{Y}$ is the same as $\mathbf{X}$). 
\begin{itemize}
\item The $j$th principal component is located in the $j$th column of $\mathbf{Y}$. 
\end{itemize}
\item Perform dimensionality reduction using $\mathbf{Y}_2 = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{V}_2$, where $\mathbf{V}_2$ denotes the matrix obtained by keeping only the first two columns of 
$\mathbf{V}$. $\mathbf{Y}_2$ denotes the reduced $n\times 2$ feature matrix containing the first two principal components of $\mathbf{X}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Harmonic Features}
\label{sec:fft}
The two largest harmonic components associated with the time-series of each MODIS pixel were extracted for each band via the Fast Fourier Transform and stored 
in the feature matrix $\mathbf{Y}_2$ (the dimension of $\mathbf{Y}_2$ is $n\times 2$). The above is realized via:
\begin{equation}
[\mathbf{Y}_2]_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
|\mathcal{F}[x_i(t)][0]|&~\textrm{if}~j=1\\
2|\mathcal{F}[x_i(t)][f_s]|&~\textrm{if}~j=2\\
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
In the above equation $x_i(t)$ denotes the time series of MODIS pixel $i$ in band $b$, $\mathcal{F}\{\}$ denotes the Fourier Transform and $fs = \frac{1}{45}$ Hz.

\subsection{Hellinger Distance}
\label{sec:HD}
The Hellinger distance between $P\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{\Sigma}_1)$ and $Q\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{u}_2,\mathbf{\Sigma}_2)$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HD}
H(P,Q) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{|\mathbf{\Sigma}_1|^{\frac{1}{4}}|\mathbf{\Sigma}_2|^{\frac{1}{4}}}{|\mathbf{M}|^{\frac{1}{2}}}\exp \{-\frac{1}{8}\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{M}^{-1}\mathbf{u}\}},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u} = (\mathbf{u}_1-\mathbf{u_2}),~~~~\mathbf{M} = \frac{\mathbf{\Sigma}_1 + \mathbf{\Sigma}_2}{2}. 
\end{equation}

\section{Results}

We plot the reduced feature space obtained using the procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:met} in Figs.~\ref{fig:density_PCA} and \ref{fig:density_FFT}. The graphs in Figs.~\ref{fig:density_PCA} and \ref{fig:density_FFT} suggest that PCA outperforms the FFT method, i.e. the two 
classes are more separable in the reduced feature space when PCA is employed as a dimensionality reduction technique if compared to when the FFT techniques is used. This observation is confirmed 
by Fig.~\ref{fig:HD}, which indicates that PCA performs about 1.3 times better (on average) than the FFT method. Fig.~\ref{fig:HD} also shows us that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The two landcover classes are the most separable in MODIS band 7 and NDVI. The two reduction methods, PCA and FFT, perform similarly for these two bands.
 \item The two landcover classes are the least separable in MODIS band 5 and 6. PCA performs significantly better than the FFT method in these two bands.
 \item The landcover classes are somewhat separable in MODIS bands 1, 2, 3, and 4. PCA performs slightly better than the FFT approach in these bands. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ref}
We presented a feature extraction comparison framework in this paper. We demonstrated its usefulness by employing it and a case study to compare two feature extraction methods,
namely FFT and PCA. For the dataset we considered here we found that the PCA method performed on average 1.3 times better than the FFT method (across the spectral dimension).
